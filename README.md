Website with various worksheet makers and teacher resources. Recently swapped scripts from plaintext js to jQuery. Original scripts are included in the repository, but not referenced from HTML


Hello! If you're reading this, I've either sent you here to view my work, or you're curious and stumbled upon it.
Feel free to use any of these files as inspiration, but please do not simply copy my work.
The most updated and currently referenced files in the js directory are the ones whose name ends in Query
They have been redone almost entirely in jQuery, and are easier to follow.

Happy Coding c:
